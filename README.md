### Project Overview
Countless dollars and entire scientific careers have been dedicated to predicting where and when the next big earthquake will strike. But unlike weather forecasting, which has significantly improved with the use of better satellites and more powerful mathematical models, earthquake prediction has been marred by repeated failure due to highly uncertain conditions of earth and its surroundings.
Now, with the help of artificial intelligence, a growing number of scientists say changes in the way they can analyze massive amounts of seismic data can help them better understand earthquakes, anticipate how they will behave, and provide quicker and more accurate early warnings. This helps in hazzard assessments for many builders and real estate business for infrastructure planning from business perspective. Also many lives can be saved through early warning. This project aims a simple solution to above problem by predicting or forecasting likely places to have earthquake in next 7 days. For user-friendly part, this project has a web application that extracts live data updated every minute by USGS.gov and predicts next likely place world wide to get hit by an earthquake, hence a realtime solution is provided.

### Problem Statement and approach to solution
Anticipating seismic tremors is a pivotal issue in Earth science because of their overwhelming and huge scope outcomes. The goal of this project is to predict where likely in the world and on what dates the earthquake will happen. Application and impact of the projectâ€‹ includes potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could spare lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure and planning. Given geological locations, magnitude and other factors in dataset from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php for 30 days past which is updated every minute, we predict or forecast 7 days time in future that is yet to come, the places where quake would likely happen. Since this is event series problem type, proposed solution in this project follows considering binary classification of earthquake occurance with training period includes fixed rolling window moving averages of past days while for which its labels, a fixed window size shifted ahead in time. The model will be trained with Adaboost classifier (RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier) and compared with XGBoost based on AUC ROC score and recall score due to the nature of problem (i.e binary classification). Model with better AUC score and recall will be considered for web app that uses Google maps api to predict places where earthquake might occur.

### Metrics

The problem addressed above is about binary classification, `Earthquake occur = 1` and `Earthquake not occur = 0` and with these prediction we try to locate co-cordinates corrosponding to the predictions and display it on the google maps api web app. More suitable metrics for binary clsssification problems are **ROC (Reciever operator characteristics), AUC (Area Under Curve), Confusion matrix for Precision, recall, accuracy and sensitivity**. One important thing about choosing metrics and model is what exactly we need from predictions and what not. To be precise, we need to **minimize or get less False negative predictions** since we dont want our model to predict as `0` or `no earthquake occured` at particular location when in reality it had actually happend as this is more dangerous than the prediction case in which prediction is `true/1` or `earthquake occured` but in reality it did not because its always **better safe than sorry!!!**. Hence apart from `roc_auc score`, I have considered
`Recall` as well for evaluation and model selection with `higher auc_roc score and recall`, where `recall = (TP/TP+FN)`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data preprocessing

This part is best explained in project walkthrough notebooks `Data/ETL_USGS_EarthQuake.ipybn` or `Data/ETL_USGS_EarthQuake.html`.
Finally the cleaned data for prediction is stored in database file `Data/Earthquakedata.db` using sql engine.

**Note** : only for project walkthrough purpose cleaned data is stored in database but for realtime analysis, in `Webapp/main.py` flask app, we extract data on the go without storing. This make sures we get realtime data any day when web app is requested by any user.

### Model implementation

As for the model selection, I have tried with Boosting algorithms for classification problem.

1. Adaboost classifier with estimator as DecisionTreeClassifier

2. Adaboosr classifier with estimator as RandomForestClassifier

3. Finally I tried Xgboost algorithm.

model selection was based on Evaluation on `roc_auc score` and `recall` and hyperparameter tunning.
A better walkthrough is mentioned with great detail in `models/Earthquake-predictor-ML-workflow.ipybn` or `models/Earthquake-predictor-ML-workflow.html`.

### Improvement and evaluation 

* I have used gridsearch CV for improving model and hyperparameter tunning on Adaboost classifier with base estimators as `DecisionTreeClassifier` and `RandomForestClassifier`.
* Using the same hyper parameters I trained XGBoost. As mentioned above, metrics for evaluation is `roc_auc score` and `recall`.

**DecisionTreeClassifier adaboost**

![DecisionTreeClassifier evaluation](https://github.com/aditya-167/Realtime-Earthquake-forecasting/blob/master/Images/DecisionTree.jpg)

1. With **adaboost decision tree classifier** and hyper parameter tunning, we get area under curve (score) = 0.8867
2. higher the auc score, better is the model since it is better at distinguishing postive and negative classes.
3. Make a note here that we get from **confusion matrix**, `False negative = 42`and `Recall score =0.7789`. We need this value apart from auc score that we will analyze later when we have tested with diffferent models below


**RandomForesClassifier adaboost**

![RandomForestClassifier evaluation](https://github.com/aditya-167/Realtime-Earthquake-forecasting/blob/master/Images/RandomForest.png)

1. Below is the auc score for **adaboost RandomForest classifier** with 0.916 which is slightly lower than Decision tree classifier
2. Moreover when we look at **confusion matrix**, `False Negative=38` and `Recall score = 0.8' can be observed which is slightly higher than recall score of decision tree. Thus performs better than decision tree adabooost 


**XGBoost model**

![XGBoost](https://github.com/aditya-167/Realtime-Earthquake-forecasting/blob/master/Images/XGboost.jpg)

1. I have also tested with xgboost model below with similar parameters as I got above, since grid search CV was taking lot of time for xgboost.
2. As we can see this significantly gives higher AUC score of almost 0.0.98 and also `False negative = 37` which is similar Random Forest adaboost but xgboost has higher True positive and less False Positve compared to Random forest adaboost. i.e `Recall score = 0.805` which is similar adaboost Random Forrest tree. But XGboost is really good at classifying positive and negative classes and also better `aur_roc_score = 0.98193`.

We can see above that xgboost algorithm has higher auc score (0.9819) than adaboost decision tree and random forest, as it is evident from the ROC curve. Hence we consider xgboost for prediction of live data and deployment in the application.

### Prediction and Web-application

* Select specific features such as `data`,`place`,`long`,`lat` and give earthquake probablity from prediction at that place and date as `quake` probability
* with taking only 7 days rolling period data from predict dataframe since this outcome value is NaN and we need to predict next 7 days period.

**Prediction for a particular day**

![prediction](https://github.com/aditya-167/Realtime-Earthquake-forecasting/blob/master/Images/predict.jpg)

**Web App**

1. Now its time to deploy the model on web application with flask and I have chosen it to deploy on https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ which is a free hosting cloud platform for web flask applications.

2. Main Idea of Application will be predicting or forecasting these earthquake sites on given day all over the world.

3. The user has option to change the date using a slider and look at predicted places all over the world where earthquake is likely to happen. [App](http://srichaditya3098.pythonanywhere.com/).

4. Application uses google maps [api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation), hence the coordinates we get from the prediction of our model needs to be converted to api format. This has been done and can be viewed `Webapp/main.py`


### Improvement and conclusion

Though XGboost model has given Higher `roc_auc` and better `recall`, I believe any work given always has some scope for improvement and in here we could also use `RNN or LSTM` for time series or `rather event series forecasting`. LSTMs have hidden memory cells that help in remembering and handeling time series or event series data well. Moreover for xgboost I have just used hyper parameters from already tuned Adaboost models, but we can also tune xgboost hyper parameter and find best parameters using GridSearchCV or RandomSearch.

**Some final thoughts** 

1. So far the model looks good with xgboost as chosen model for predictions in web app haveing higher auc score and higher recall_score as I have explained under XGBoost result section why auc and recall score are chosen.

2. Our main Aim is to predict wether earthquake will happen or not at a given day and place. So we definitely would **not like the model with higher False Neagtive values , since its more dangerous to predict as no earthquake while in reality earthquake happend than predicting earthquake will happen given in reality it did not**. We can allow False positive more than False negative

3. After seeing these comparision on auc_roc score, confusion matrix, and recall score, since all the above algorithm have given similar result with slightly different recall scores, Xgboost with `FN=37` but with higher `auc_score 0f 0.98` performs over-all better. Hence for webapplication deployment, I have chosen Xgboost as it also faster than adaboost.

Hence with all the mentioned implementation, the web application was successfully deployed and necessary project walktrhough can be accessed from `Data and models` directory.
